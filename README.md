# TodoApp-Playwright-Automation

In this Project the idea is to automate a current website using Playwright.

The requirements to complete the testing process will be:

As the client, I need you to automate end-to-end tests for the TodoMVC React app at https://todomvc.com/examples/react/dist/ to ensure core task management works flawlessly across browsers.
App Overview
This is a single-page React app implementing the standard TodoMVC spec: users add, view, edit, complete, filter, and clear tasks in a simple list interface with an input field, list items (each with checkbox, label, destroy button), and bottom controls for filters (All/Active/Completed) and counts/clear button.
Key UI elements include a header input (“What needs to be done?”), dynamic  .todo-list li  items,  .toggle  checkboxes,  .edit  fields,  .filters a  links, and  .todo-count / .clear-completed .
Test Requirements
Create at least 5 robust tests using Playwright (TypeScript preferred, POM encouraged), with assertions, tags (@smoke, @regression), retries (max 2), and config for screenshots/videos/traces on failure.
Run on Chromium (headed/debug options), generate HTML reports, integrate GitHub Actions for CI.
